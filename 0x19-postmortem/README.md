**Issue Summary:**
- **Duration:** April 10, 2024, 10:00 PM - April 11, 2024, 2:00 AM (UTC)
- **Impact:** A significant portion of users experienced intermittent connectivity issues and slow response times, resulting in a 20% increase in error rates across the platform.
- **Root Cause:** A misconfiguration in the load balancer settings led to uneven distribution of traffic among backend servers, causing overload and degraded performance.

**Timeline:**
- **10:00 PM:** Issue detected through monitoring alerts showing increased error rates.
- **10:15 PM:** Engineers investigated backend server logs, suspecting database performance issues.
- **10:45 PM:** Load balancer configurations checked for anomalies; no issues found initially.
- **11:30 PM:** Error patterns analyzed to identify the affected geographical regions.
- **12:00 AM:** Incident escalated to the infrastructure team for further investigation.
- **1:00 AM:** Load balancer logs scrutinized, revealing misconfigured routing rules.
- **1:30 AM:** Load balancer settings corrected to evenly distribute traffic among servers.
- **2:00 AM:** System performance monitored, confirming the issue resolution.

**Root Cause and Resolution:**
The root cause of the issue was traced back to a misconfiguration in the load balancer's routing rules. Certain backend servers were receiving a disproportionate amount of traffic, leading to overloads and degraded performance. The issue was resolved by correcting the load balancer settings to evenly distribute incoming requests among all available servers.

**Corrective and Preventative Measures:**
- **Load Balancer Configuration Review:** Conduct a comprehensive review of load balancer configurations to ensure proper routing rules are in place.
- **Automated Monitoring:** Implement automated monitoring to detect and alert on load balancer configuration changes.
- **Regular Audits:** Schedule regular audits of critical infrastructure components to identify and address misconfigurations proactively.
- **Documentation Update:** Document the troubleshooting process and resolution steps for similar incidents in the future.
- **Team Training:** Provide training sessions for engineers on load balancer management and troubleshooting techniques.
